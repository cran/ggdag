# ggdag 0.2.0
* Fixed compatibility issue with ggraph 2.0.0 by changing to `strength` parameter in curved geoms
* Fixed join bug in `node_equivalent_class()` that didn't account for the way dagitty returns DAGs with no direction
* Fixed join bug in `node_equivalent_class()` that didn't check `to` node
* Implemented `is_false()` to avoid dependency on R 3.5.0
* improved edge lengths
* add `{}` to adjustment set names to reflect convention
* Set nodes to be unstyled by default
* Changed default themes and scales to be more like base ggplot2
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
