\title{Quickly scale the size of a ggplot}
\usage{
expand_plot(
  expand_x = expansion(c(0.1, 0.1)),
  expand_y = expansion(c(0.1, 0.1))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expand_x, expand_y}{Vector of range expansion constants used to add some
padding around the data, to ensure that they are placed some distance away
from the axes. Use the convenience function \code{ggplot2::expansion()} to
generate the values for the expand argument.}
}
\description{
\code{expand_plot()} is a convenience function that expands the scales of a
ggplot, as the large node sizes in a DAG will often get clipped in themes
that don't have DAGs in mind.
